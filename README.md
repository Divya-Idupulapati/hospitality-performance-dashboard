##  Project Summary

This project delivers a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes operational and financial performance across multiple hotel properties. Key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Occupancy %, Realisation %, and Cancellation % are calculated and visualized to help stakeholders monitor business health and optimize operations.

---

## Business Challenge

The organization faced declining revenue and inconsistent occupancy trends due to limited access to consolidated performance data. Decision-making was reactive and lacked a centralized view of operations across cities, properties, and booking platforms. An analytics-driven dashboard was needed to improve visibility and enable proactive strategies.

---

## Objectives

- Visualize critical KPIs: Revenue, Occupancy %, RevPAR, ADR, Realisation, and Cancellations.
- Identify trends across weekdays, weekends, and weeks.
- Compare performance by city, property, room class, and booking platform.
- Analyze customer rating trends and efficiency of booking channels.
- Enable executive leadership to make faster and more informed decisions.
